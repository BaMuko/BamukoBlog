description: "aka how plan to finish my first game"

I have had difficulty finishing my game projects in the past, as I often feel like they are missing something. This has led to a year-long hiatus from game development, but I am determined to break through this barrier. 

Even though I had originally planned to work on a different game, one that my partner and I would enjoy playing and that I could potentially convince my LAN party friends to try, I have decided to focus on finishing the game I started during Ludumdare 53. 

While I envision the final game to be in 3D, my current skills are not sufficient, so I will start with a 2D version. But before I begin planning, let`s review the feedback I received from Ludumdare 53
