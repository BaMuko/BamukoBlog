First of all, I figure it out that I have a problem with active reading. My retention from the articles is close to zero, i just know that "they wrote about it somewhere over here" but I am not able to come up with specifics task. 

Composition vs inheritance?

Component based entity framework?

Singleton > just a global variable, something like that was mentioned here: https://github.com/Digitaler-Impfnachweis/covpass-android#dependency-injection

Solution to injecting dependencies:
	> singletion
	> IoC
	> Manual injection
