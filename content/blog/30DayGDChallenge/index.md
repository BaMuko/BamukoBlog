I signed up for a [course](https://skvt.cz/course/122-game-design-pro-zacatecniky "course"). As a way to prepare, 
I have challenged myself to come up with an idea each day starting from May 9th until June 9th. 


I will continuously update this blog as time goes on. :)


### Take one, leave the rest

This idea is somehow based on the first game I tried by myself in Unity. It is about heaven being almost at its capacity when it is only 
able to take one last soul into heaven. But the souls keep coming to the heaven stairs, so you have to keep them away until the right soul reaches the stairs.

### Progress will make you weaker

During this theme, I figured out that I am able to dream about something, but as it is with dreams, I am not able to give it a proper shape. This is something that has always hindered me during game jams.

To combat this, I will try to come up with a sort of template that I can use to guide me during this challenge.

Anyway, I was thinking about a game where you have 100 points to move. If you move forward by your own will, you will lose a point. If you move backward, you will gain a point, and moving left to right will not cost you any points.

There would be 8 possible directions to choose from by moving left or right, and each direction presents different choices that can either hinder your progress or push you forward faster. Sometimes, there could be locked doors that require a key to open. To acquire the key, you would need to go backwards and try different directions. Once you have the key, you would need to go backwards again to reach the locked door. Or something like that!
