On 2023-05-03, I signed up for a [course](https://skvt.cz/course/122-game-design-pro-zacatecniky "course") to prepare myself to attend. 
As a way to prepare, I have challenged myself to come up with an idea each day starting from May 9th until June 9th. 

I will continuously update this blog as time goes on


## Take one, leave the rest

This idea is somehow based on the first game I tried by myself in Unity. It is about heaven being almost at its capacity when it is only 
able to take one last soul into heaven. But the souls keep coming to the heaven stairs, so you have to keep them away until the right soul reaches the stairs.

## Progress will make you weaker
