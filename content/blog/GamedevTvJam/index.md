I've signed up for a week-long [game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2023? "gamejam") called GameDevTV Jam 2023 because they're offering a free course on their site just for participating and submitting a game!

Now, I'm not saying I'm addicted to tutorials or anything like that. I believe I've moved past that stage. But they have courses on Blender and drawing, which could be interesting additions to my skill set. I mean, who knows? Besides, the theme of the game jam is "Life in 2 dimensions," which perfectly aligns with an [idea] (https://robinontheway.com/30DayGDChallenge/#one-room "idea") from  my personal challenge I've been obsessing over lately. I just need to make a few adjustments, like switching from day night cycle to dimensions with lights and no lights, and voil√†!

I should note that my available time for working on the game will be limited due to other commitments. Over the weekend, I'll be away in nature, and during the work week, I'll only have mornings to dedicate to the game development. This leaves me with approximately 15 hours to complete the game, which far less then I have ever tried, but we will see. :)

As usual, I will continuously update this blog as time goes on. :)

I spent around two and a half hours playing around with designs in Inkscape and then some time in Unity creating the light rays. There were numerous approaches I could have taken, but ultimately I decided to use particle effects. This choice not only achieved the desired effect of light rays but also added a dynamic element to the scene, giving it a nice touch of liveliness. Next goal is to create a character with 6-directional movement. I've found some inspiration on the internet that I'll use as a reference for the movement ratios.
