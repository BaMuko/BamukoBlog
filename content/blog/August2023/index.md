> "I did not get a chance" – a sentence from "Million Dollar Baby" that sparked a profound emotion within me. It prompted a realization that every day, I'm presented with an opportunity to engage in something I genuinely desire. It would truly be a regrettable circumstance to pass away without discovering whether my passion holds true, or if I possess the capability to transform it into reality.

This is going to be the first series I'll be writing on a regular basis. Each post will correspond to a specific month, capturing what I've been focusing on and more. Recognizing the importance of having a routine to achieve my goals, I'll be tracking the time spent on various topics. Additionally, I'll be planning and preparing blog content in advance, outlining my monthly focus to stay on track.

### Focus of the month

August is going to revolve around the theme of art. During this month, I plan to delve into various aspects of art, including learning Blender, honing my drawing skills, and exploring shaders. Additionally, I will dedicate some time to GatsbyJS to improve my blogging capabilities. These are the four skills I would like to explore, which go hand in hand with the idea that I am able to dedicate at least 4 hours a day to learning. You know, considering 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work (which can feel like quite a waste, right :)), and 8 hours of free time, of which I intend to spend half with my fiancée. We'll see if this plan is achievable.

### Reflection

As this is my first reflection it will be probably a little bit breakneck, but I will get there, somehow, sometime.

In the 'Focus of the Month' section, I articulated my intention to dedicate 4 hours each day to learning. Initially, I presumed this would be a straightforward goal to achieve. However, reality proved otherwise, as it proved to be more challenging than anticipated. My average daily learning time currently stands at: __. This led me to introspect and ponder, 'Is it feasible for fatigue from sleep or work to impede my ability to carve out the necessary time for propelling myself toward the finish line?' Seeking resolution, I allocated a day of leave from my conventional 9-to-5 occupation, only to discover that I managed to engage in learning for a mere 3 hours and 36 minutes. It was this nagging feeling that I should create something and it kept distracting me. Initially, the concept revolved around a space racer, but later transitioned into a platformer. Eventually, I circled back to one of my earlier ideas—a turn-based game. This transition consumed a substantial amount of my energy, as it invariably does whenever I delve into the intricate realm of game design and strategize approaches. Nonetheless, despite the energy expended, the process was imbued with an undeniable sense of enjoyment. Therefore I decided that I am not longer going to fight with it and create something what I call "The case of a boring game" as I am going to finish something even thought it is going to be totaly boring. The main point is to finish it. Not just another prototype. Finished game.

Nonetheless, it proved to be a month of significance, owing to the invaluable principle of '50/50' that I integrated while embarking on the course-driven journey, drawing inspiration from [draw a box](https://www.drawabox.com "drawabox") a balance of 50% focused study intertwined with 50% hands-on practice. This approach prevented me from merely consuming plain tutorials, often referred to as 'spoonfeeding.' Instead, it urged me to engage actively and endeavor on my own. This method not only aids in understanding the concepts profoundly but also solidifies new knowledge by melding it through the crucible of practical application.

Moving forward, my intention is to delve into the intricate details of each pursuit undertaken during the month, accompanied by a breakdown of the time invested in these endeavors.

#### Blender

##### Courses from Grant Abbit

Truly, this extraordinary individual stands as the finest mentor I've encountered in my pursuit of mastering Blender. His unique teaching style, filled with a challenges that beckon us to deep our understanding, evokes memories of the great Jonathan Weinberger, whose courses opened the gateway to my world of game development.

###### Blender Environment Artist: Create 3D Game Worlds

[This](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/1672425 "gamedev tv blender course") is the course which I aquired in the GMKT game jam. To be honest I tried to learn the Blender in past few times, so I was familiar with few of the tools, but not that much, so I think it is safe to say that if you just start you are in the same position as I was.

I had completed around 24% of the course, and I was somewhere in the texturing module, which came after the module where I learned to build a roof, when I realized that I did not want to start learning how to do texturing. Instead, I would rather continue focusing on creating basic stuff to have a firm grasp of the tools before moving on to other tools in Blender. This thinking led me to separate the basics into following categories:

> * modeling
> * scupulting
> * texturing
> * topology
> * rigging

So, during those 24%, I focused on learning everything connected to the usage of tools for modeling, such as extrusion, beveling, inserting faces, rotation, scaling, moving, loop cuts, and more. After the 24% I stopped working on the course and moved to GetGood series.

###### GetGood

To practice a bit more of modeling I was looking for some good source to do so and found out that my favorite tutor has exactly the [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98FkRIbihyQ&list=PLn3ukorJv4vvv3ZpWJYvV5Tmvo7ISO-NN&ab_channel=GrantAbbitt "daily practise") I need. But do not get mistaken that it is only about practise, there is a lot more to learn than I would think. Most scary of all the new knowledge is called "topology" that is something what I have a hard time to wrap my head around (at least for now).

###### Low-poly character

I was on the hunt for something I could do to adhere to the 50/50 rule, therefore I decided to create an astronaut for the game brewing in my mind. To get me on the right track I used [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OUYOKGl7x0&ab_channel=GrantAbbitt "low poly character course"). However, after setting up the background and examining the final model, I believe the course was no longer necessary (this is my perspective after reaching GetGood Level 6). However, to my surprise, I encountered a hurdle in animating it using  [mixamo](https://mixamo.com/).  To achieve animation, it seems I'll need to acquaint myself with a Blender plugin. I suspect this will form the focal point for my endeavors in September. Yet, the final decision remains pending.

#### ShaderGraphs

##### Ben Cloward - Shader graph basics

Right from the start, I dived into Gabriel's courses, eager to roll up my sleeves and get into the thick of it. And okay, it seemed pretty straightforward initially, but soon enough, I realized there were gaps in what I knew. I had a rough idea of how things worked, you know? I even whipped up a test shader to put my theories to the test, but I still craved that clear explanation in black and white. So here's the deal: I'm giving a thumbs-up to kick off with this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX_6_bKpP9g&list=PL78XDi0TS4lEBWa2Hpzg2SRC5njCcKydl&pp=iAQB "course") - it's like building your base, giving you solid ground to take on shader graphs with confidence.

##### Hands-on practise

Most of the the hands-on practice are going to be based on Gabriel Aguiar [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPd_BKEUoYjcFaqriaMchx5gOqBs2tDh) of "How to`s" as I believe it will do the trick which will help me put knowledge from Ben into a practice.

###### Moss

My curiosity was piqued by the concept of creating moss, particularly after encountering an appealing image of moss-covered hexagons. This exploration was not only driven by aesthetics but also served as a valuable learning opportunity due to the intricate interplay of normal textures, diffuse textures, and roughness textures. The process involved blending the base texture with the moss texture.

* [Moss](https://youtu.be/Q43XBychCEY)
  * can be combined with with [view, world, object & tangent](https://youtu.be/E6Srr-HaicI) which will allow you to honor the shape of the object given by normals
  * the moss course also introduced blending normal maps, which is done lerping the textures, but there is an [another approach](https://youtu.be/GKVBJ7aO1Mk) to it
  * there were two more videos on how to improve normal maps, but they required having textures prepared in a specific manner. I chose to skip it as I did not want to spend time by preparing the textures for it.

![normalDiff](./normalDiff.png "After normal blend course: left is original, after course")

As a testament to my skills, I attempted to apply moss to the cube. However, the same method only worked on one side (the top), which wasn't the desired outcome. I realized I needed a gradient from bottom to the top of the cube. Nevertheless, I was uncertain about the approach until I came across the [lenght & distance](https://youtu.be/wTHKzjYBH7U) tutorial, which demonstrated how to move the pivot of the UVs which did the trick.

While I was attempting to merge this knowledge with insights from [view, world, object & tangent](https://youtu.be/E6Srr-HaicI) to properly honor the shape bestowed by normals on the object, a realization dawned that I lacked clarity about the behavior of vectors during their transformation from tangent space to another space. And let me tell you, it took an unexpected turn from there. I scoured the internet, embarking on a journey that carried me from elementary tutorials to the comprehensive courses on [math planet](https://www.mathplanet.com/) and the captivating streams by [Freya Holmér](https://www.youtube.com/@Acegikmo). Both captivated my attention. It seems the time has come to tread the path of "To learn MATH" on my journey.
