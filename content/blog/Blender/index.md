### Courses from Gran Abbit

Honestly this guy is by far the best I have met to learn the Blender. With his approach where he challenges you he reminds me a lot Jonathan Weinberger with his courses (which were my gate to the game development world)

#### Blender Environment Artist: Create 3D Game Worlds

[This](https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/1672425 "gamedev tv blender course") is the course which I aquired in the GMKT game jam. I knew the tutor Gran Abbit from the youtube so I was pretty sure he is going to be awesome and he was. I learned quite a few stuff, nowhere near the things I need to achieve, but it helped a lot. To be honest I tried to learn the Blender in past few times, so I was familiar with few of the tools, but not that much, so I think it is safe to say that if you just start you are in the same position as I was. 

#### GetGood

I was thinking I need to practise a bit more so I was looking for some good source for practise and found out that my favorite tutor has exactly the [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98FkRIbihyQ&list=PLn3ukorJv4vvv3ZpWJYvV5Tmvo7ISO-NN&ab_channel=GrantAbbitt "daily practise") I need.
