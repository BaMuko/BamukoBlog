This post will guide you through my journey of learning shaders in Unity. My ultimate objective is to create an environment reminiscent of the one found in 'Master of Anima.', beucase I would like to recreate some of its mechanics which I intend to infuse them with a unique interpretation.

### Ben Cloward - Shader graph basics

Right from the start, I dived into Gabriel's courses, eager to roll up my sleeves and get into the thick of it. And okay, it seemed pretty straightforward initially, but soon enough, I realized there were gaps in what I knew. I had a rough idea of how things worked, you know? I even whipped up a test shader to put my theories to the test, but I still craved that clear explanation in black and white. So here's the deal: I'm giving a thumbs-up to kick off with this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX_6_bKpP9g&list=PL78XDi0TS4lEBWa2Hpzg2SRC5njCcKydl&pp=iAQB "course") - it's like building your base, giving you solid ground to take on shader graphs with confidence.

Embrace the journey through this course, much like charting unknown terrain. Personally, I've taken on the '50/50' principle, drawing inspiration from [draw a box](https://www.drawabox.com "drawabox") a balance of 50% focused study intertwined with 50% immersive hands-on practice with courses from Gabriel Aguiar, like trying [moss](https://youtu.be/Q43XBychCEY) after [view, world, object & tangent](https://youtu.be/E6Srr-HaicI) which will take the moss from Gabriel a little bit futher.

### Gabriel Aguiar - Unity Shader graph tutorial

During this course, or better to say list of "how tos" for specific type of shaders, I applied what I have leared in Ben Cloward course.
