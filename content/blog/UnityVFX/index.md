The goal is to create VFX for the game I have in mind, and gosh, I am looking forward to getting it out of my head as I am not able to "crack" it just yet, and it's killing me.

I once tried to get into VFX, but there was a lot to cover and I wasn't sure where the right place to start was. But this time, I decided to start somewhere and see where the road will lead.

## Shaders

The world is build on shaders. Huh? Not sure, but it sounds cool. :)

I wanted to begin with the tutorial I purchased on Udemy when I previously attempted to learn VFX. However, after the instructor covered the basics of VFX and introduced the first VFX project, there were too many unfamiliar tools involved, such as shaders, particles, Blender, and GIMP. This overwhelmed me, as I prefer to have a basic understanding of the tools before using them. Consequently, I decided to pause the tutorial and carefully consider where to begin my VFX journey.

After conducting a short search, I decided to begin my VFX journey with shader graphs in Unity. I found the official Unity documentation on [shader graphs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@5.6/manual/Getting-Started.html "shader graphs manual")  to be a valuable resource. I've become less fond of video tutorials and prefer reading documentation when available, although Unity doesn't always provide extensive documentation on certain topics. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the information I found.

Once I grasped the basics from the documentation, I experimented with shaders in Unity by applying textures to cubes. However, I realized that I lacked the imagination to fully explore the possibilities of shader graphs. To enhance my understanding, I sought out another [tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/make-a-flag-move-with-shadergrap "make a flag move with shadegraph") and watched it.

During the tutorial, I encountered some challenges, particularly with previewing shaders in the shader graph for opaque materials. I found a [solution](https://forum.unity.com/threads/main-preview-in-shader-graph-is-blank.1412793/ "solution") to this issue by following a forum thread. The tutorial provided me with a better idea of how to utilize shader graphs, but I wanted more practice. As a result, I have a plan to follow a [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O75iGGUQXBI&list=PLpPd_BKEUoYjcFaqriaMchx5gOqBs2tDh&ab_channel=GabrielAguiarProd "Gabriel AguiarProd unity shader graphs tutorial") and then attempt to convert some Blender shader graphs into Unity shader graphs based on videos from another [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M0Puwo3kB4&list=PLsGl9GczcgBs6TtApKKK-L_0Nm6fovNPk&ab_channel=RyanKingArt "Blender shader graph tutorials").

In any case, I will provide more detailed updates in a [shaderlearning](https://robinontheway.com/UnityShaderGraph "separate post") as the main purpose of this one is to describe my VFX learning journey.
